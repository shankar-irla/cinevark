Cinevark is an AI-powered movie recommendation web app that helps users discover the right movie to watch based on their mood, preferences, or a shortlist of confusing options. Built with Streamlit and powered by TMDb 5000 dataset, it combines collaborative filtering, content-based logic, and mood-based decision making — all wrapped in a modern, YouTube-like UI.
